# Wordle in C
A game where you guess the letters of the word. If your guess contains the letter of the targetted word, the game will let you know.

## Incomplete
This is not complete at the moment, There are few issues and missing features. 
### Issues
- After each correct guess, the program will say "Last one" or "Next one" even if its the last word. The intention was to show the valid message at the right time. (Next one if the game continues,
  Last one if it is going to end. I suspect the problem is in the if else statement that is printing these messages.
### Features
A feature that must be in the game that is missing 
- If a character you guessed exists in the word, It will say that it exists, but not in the right position.
